## âœ¨ Highlights

- Propose CEVG-RTNet for high-accuracy, real-time smoke detection on low-power devices.  
- Introduce SCPP-Conv to boost detection in low-contrast, transparent smoke scenes.  
- Use HRFA for multi-scale fusion and alignment of local details and global context.
- Design DRFE to enhance adaptability via recursive and cross-channel attention.
- Propose PolyIoU loss modeling shape, size, position via dynamic weights for accuracy.
